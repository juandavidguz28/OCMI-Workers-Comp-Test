This flexibility allows developers to write tests that run reliably on multiple browsers, ensuring consistent user experiences.
 
Additionally, Playwright's robust testing framework and developer-friendly features, such as built-in debugging tools and support for modern web standards, make it a preferred tool for end-to-end testing.
Its reliability and ease of use are key factors driving its adoption among automation teams.`;
